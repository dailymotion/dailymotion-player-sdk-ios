#Dailymotion Objective-C SDK

This repository contains the official open source Objective-C SDK that allows you to embed Dailymotion Videos in your iOS application.

See documentation at http://www.dailymotion.com/doc/api/sdk-objc.html

##Installation

###CocoaPods

Coming soon...

###Manually

Just drag and drop the `dailymotion-player-objc` folder into your project.

##Usage

Check out the repository and open `dailymotion-sdk-objc.xcodeproj` for a working example of how to embed the Dailymotion Player into your app.

Also look at the `init` methods of `DMPlayerViewController` for ways to embed the Dailymotion Player without using storyboards.
